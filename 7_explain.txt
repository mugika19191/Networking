Right now the network is using a **/28 mask (255.255.255.240)**, which gives subnets of 16 IP addresses each (14 usable hosts).

The IPs you have:

* `95.198.14.2`
* `95.198.14.18`
* `95.198.14.19`
* `95.198.14.253`
* `95.198.14.254`

These addresses belong to **different /28 subnets**, for example:

* `95.198.14.0/28` → usable 1–14 (includes `.2`)
* `95.198.14.16/28` → usable 17–30 (includes `.18`, `.19`)
* `95.198.14.240/28` → usable 241–254 (includes `.253`, `.254`)

Because you are routing between **different subnets**, this setup works with routing rules as defined.

If you change the mask to **255.255.255.0 (/24)**, all of these IPs (`95.198.14.x`) would **fall into the same subnet (95.198.14.0/24)**.

That would cause:

1. Devices would **think they are on the same local network** and would try to ARP for each other directly.
2. Your routers would **not forward packets**, because routing between interfaces in the same subnet doesn’t work as expected.
3. The gateways (`95.198.14.1`, `.18`, `.253`, `.254`) would no longer make sense as separate next-hops, since everything appears "local".

Basically, with /24, **you lose the separation into multiple routed subnets**, so your routing table setup no longer applies.
